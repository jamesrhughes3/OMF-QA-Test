##Personal Notes
1.  I have included comments as needed to try and explain my thought process on certain decisions made while automating these scenarios.
2.  If any of my style or formatting choices seem outdated, I apologize.  It's been a bit since I've used Ruby, but it's been fun to get back into it.
3.  Thank you for your time and consideration.
